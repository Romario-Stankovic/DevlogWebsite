                    Hello, my name is Romario and I am a self taught programmer and game developer. Currently, I am a student at Singidunum University in Belgrade, Serbia learning to be a Software and Data Engineer. The reason I enrolled in this type of study is because I want to gain more knowledge about the world of computers and electronic systems. So far, I've been taught to make websites with HTML/CSS/JS by two amazing professors! <br>
                    Like everyone else, I have some hobbies too! My favorite one is gaming! It's entertaining and versatile. From relaxing to competitive. That is the basics of it, if you want to learn more, send a message or email.
