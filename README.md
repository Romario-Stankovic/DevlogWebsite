<h1 align="center">Devlog Website</h1>

"Devlog Website" is a final exam project from the "Web Design" course at Singidunum University. The course was designed to teach students the fundamentals of web design using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. For the final exam, students were tasked to create a static website with multiple pages using these technologies.

The topic for the website was free, but there were some minimal requirements that should be followed, such as: minimum four pages, each page should be styled using one css file, there should be at least one call to an external API, and we had to have a form that uses RegEx to validate the user input.
