<h1 align="center">Devlog Website</h1>

This project was given as a final exam project for "Web Design" at Singidunum University. The goal of this course was to teach students about fundamentals of web design and how static web pages are created. For the final exam, we were tasked to create a multi-page website using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The website had a free topic but had to meet some minimum requirements. There should be at least 4 different pages, we had to use CSS to style the website and we had to include a Web API of some kind to interact with through our webpage. One other requirement was to have a contact form where we would validate user input through JavaScript and RegEx.
